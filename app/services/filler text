Restoration Process
Our restoration process is designed to address both minor and significant issues with stained glass. This includes:

Releading: Replacing the cames (metal strips) that hold the glass together, ensuring structural integrity.
Repair and Replacement: Expertly repairing broken glass or replacing damaged sections with matching materials to maintain the authenticity of the design.
